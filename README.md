The project demonstartes how to used DeepFace for an effective Face Emotion Recognition system. 

DeepFace can automatically detect and analyze various aspects of a face, such as the emotion expressed, age, gender, and race, with the help of pre-trained models.

The program uses a face detection model named Haar Cascade Classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) to detect face in the videocapture and the using DeepFace analyse users emotion
